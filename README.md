# SF Crime Map

Geographic data visualization and analytics for San Francisco crime. This is an ongoing project, with the current live version [here](https://djfletcher.github.io/SFDataViz/).

## Features in Development:
+ Filter by crime type.
+ Click individual crime spots for details about that crime.
+ Creation of a Node/Express backend to handle the point-in-polygon logic that currently slows down the browser and disrupts UX.
+ Address search, including autocomplete.
+ Access user's geolocation and plot it on map.
